# Horiseon

For this challenge I was given a starter code for a website. To be able to fully complete the challenge I had to add comments to the CSS file, make all the buttons of the header to work properly, add alternate placeholders for images, change the title name tab, and rearrange the classes/ids to follow a propper structure.
